				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>
					My name is Callan Eckett, also know on the interwebs as Pvt. Mongrel or Mongrel Computing. 
					I’m a 16 year old English developer that has been programming since the age of 11, and building computers since 13. 
					The first language I learnt was C#, for developing mods for the game terraria. However I quickly transitioned to python after a couple of months. 
					Currently I’m focusing on languages such as python, perl and lua for application & game development.
